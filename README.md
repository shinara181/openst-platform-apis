## Setup openST Platform

####Terminal 1

```bash
  > npm install
```

* Start the openST platform setup. Setup script will create "openst-setup" folder in your $HOME folder. Setup folder contains:

1. openst-geth-value - Acts as ethereum MainNet for development/test environment. Chain runs on POW consensus algorithm.
2. openst-geth-utility - Acts as openST side chain network for development/test environment. Chain runs on POA consensus algorithm.  
3. bin - folder contains multiple executables for platform chains and services
4. logs - folder contains logs generated by executables in bin folder

```bash
  > node node_modules/@openstfoundation/openst-platform/tools/setup/index.js
```

* Load platform environment variables  

```bash
  > source $HOME/openst-setup/openst_env_vars.sh
```

* Start all platform services in background (i.e. geth nodes and intercoms processes). We keep checking if all required services are up and running and publish alert messages if any service goes down. You can also run these services individually as well.   
```bash
  > node node_modules/@openstfoundation/openst-platform/tools/platform/start_services.js
```

####Terminal 2

* Load platform environment variables  

```bash
  > source $HOME/openst-setup/openst_env_vars.sh
